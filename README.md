One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

If you want to use this application and customize it you will need to install:

- Node.js
```
https://nodejs.org/es/download/
```

- Sass:
```
npm install -g sass
```

All the customize features are implemented with Sass. Taking that into account, you will need to understand how to compile the Sass code into Css.

If you use the main structure implemented in this repository, just introduce the following code in the Terminal:

```
sass --watch assets/scss/index.scss:assets/css/index.css
```
